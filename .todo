Assignment:
   ☐ Build a browser form which collects Email, Country, Zip Code, Password and Password Confirmation fields
   ☐ Use live inline validation to inform the user whether a field is properly filled in or not.  That means highlighting a field red and providing a helpful error message until it has been filled in properly.

To Do:
   ✔ Set up a blank HTML document @done(21-01-04 18:39)
   ✔ Think about how you would set up the different form elements and their accompanying validators. What objects and functions will you need? A few minutes of thought can save you from wasting an hour of coding. The best thing you can do is whiteboard the entire solution before even touching the computer. @done(21-01-04 18:40)
   ✔ Write the simple form elements. Don’t worry about styling them. @done(21-01-04 19:08)
   ☐ Add the JavaScript code that checks validation as the user progresses through the form. When a user leaves a form field it should automatically validate that field.
   ☐ Test out all possible cases.
